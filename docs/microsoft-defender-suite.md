### MDCA

#### what

It's a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) solution. focuses on SaaS application security and user behaviors.

#### setup 
[getting started MDCA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/get-started)

- prereq: you must at least be a Security Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365
- RBAC for admins needed? [manage admin]([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-admins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-admins))
- connect cloud apps
- set up DLP
- set up policy
- set up cloud discovery
- organize data with tags and IP address
- [daily activities to increase posture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/daily-activities-to-protect-your-cloud-environment)
- [best practice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/best-practices)

**best practice**

[dcaddick](https://dcaddick.github.io/gsd_public/MDCA/) and [microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/best-practices)

- Discover and assess cloud apps
- Apply cloud governance policies
- Limit exposure of shared data and enforce collaboration policies
- Discover, classify, label, and protect regulated and sensitive data stored in the cloud
- Enforce DLP and compliance policies for data stored in the cloud
- Block and protect download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices
- Secure collaboration with external users by enforcing real-time session controls
- Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, malicious insiders, and ransomware
- Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations
- Secure IaaS services and custom apps

##### connect apps

this is basically posture assessment using MDCA for SaaS. see also MDC (more appropriate for azure infra as opposed to SaaS)

**workflow**:
1. Defender for Cloud Apps scans and saves authentication permissions.
2. Defender for Cloud Apps requests the user list. The first time the request is done, it may take some time until the scan completes. After the user scan is over, Defender for Cloud Apps moves on to activities and files. As soon as the scan starts, some activities will be available in Defender for Cloud Apps.
3. After completion of the user request, Defender for Cloud Apps periodically scans users, groups, activities, and files. All activities will be available after the first full scan.

**capabilities (depends on CSP)**:
- **Account information**Â - Visibility into users, accounts, profile information, status (suspended, active, disabled) groups, and privileges.
- **Audit trail**Â - Visibility into user activities, admin activities, sign-in activities.
- **Account governance**Â - Ability to suspend users, revoke passwords, etc.
- **App permissions**Â - Visibility into issued tokens and their permissions.
- **App permission governance**Â - Ability to remove tokens.
- **Data scan**Â - Scanning of unstructured data using two processes -periodically (every 12 hours) and in real-time scan (triggered each time a change is detected).
- **Data governance**Â - Ability to quarantine files, including files in trash, and overwrite files.

**how to**  [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps)

##### set up dlp

read on file policies and purview below
##### set up cloud discovery 

you can set up MDCA to discover apps, guide [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/set-up-cloud-discovery)

Cloud discovery analyzes your traffic logs against the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps catalog of over 31,000 cloud apps. 

you can have snapshot (one time upload of your traffic to be analyzed) or continuous report (use log collector, connector or cloud API to continuously upload).
##### set up policies

[policy guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/control-cloud-apps-with-policies)

Policies allow you to define the way you want your users to behave in the cloud. If necessary, you can integrate remediation work flows to achieve complete risk mitigation.
The following types of policies can be created:

| Policy type icon                                                                                                            | Policy type              | Category               | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

###### activity policy
[how to](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/user-activity-policies)

- To ensure that you only include results where the specified filter field has a value, we recommend adding the same field again using theÂ **is set**Â test. For example, when filtering byÂ **Location**Â _does not equal_Â a specified list of countries/regions, also add a filter forÂ **Location**Â _is set_. You can also preview the filter results by selectingÂ **Edit and preview results**.
- When a filter is set toÂ _does not equal_Â and the attribute does not exist on the event, the event will not be filtered out. For example, filtering onÂ **Device Tag does not equal Microsoft Entra hybrid joined**Â doesn't filter out events that do not containÂ **Device tag**, even if the device is Microsoft Entra joined.
- In case of a guest user, there may be cases where theÂ **User From Group**Â filter doesn't recognize the account by its domain. To make sure all guest users are included, use theÂ **External users**Â as the group, if it meets your needs for the policy.

###### file policy
[how to](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/data-protection-policies)
You are limited to 50 file policies in Defender for Cloud Apps.
also read [common data protection policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/policies-information-protection)

**best practice**
1. Avoid resetting the file policy (by using theÂ **Reset results and apply actions again**Â checkbox) in production environments unless it's absolutely necessary, as doing so will initiate a full scan of the files covered by the policy, which can have a negative impact on its performance.
2. When applying labels to files in a specific parent folderÂ **and**Â its subfolders, use theÂ **Apply to**Â ->Â **Selected folders**Â option. Then add each of the parent folders.
3. When applying labels to files in a specific folder only (excluding any subfolders), use the file policy filterÂ **Parent Folder**Â with theÂ **Equals**Â operator.
4. File policy is faster when narrow filtering criteria are used (as compared to wide criteria).
5. Consolidate several file policies for the same service (such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Box, and so on) to a single policy.
6. When enabling file monitoring (from theÂ **Settings**Â page), create at least one file policy. When no file policy exists, or is disabled for seven consecutive days, file monitoring is autodisabled.

##### integrating with other services

###### purview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps lets you automatically apply sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview. These labels are applied to files as a file policy governance action, and depending on the label configuration, can apply encryption for additional protection. You can also investigate files by filtering for the applied sensitivity label within Defender for Cloud Apps. Using labels enables greater visibility and control of your sensitive data in the cloud.
[how to](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/azip-integration#how-to-integrate-microsoft-purview-with-defender-for-cloud-apps)

**prerequisite** 
- a Defender for Cloud Apps license and a license for Microsoft Purview.
