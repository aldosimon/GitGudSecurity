# GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is AWSâ€™s managed threat detection service It leverages three primary data feeds:
- CloudTrail
- VPC Flow Logs
- DNS Query Logs 
The findings it produces are either around an Identity or a Network-based device. The findings can also be **explicit** or **anomaly-based**. With Delegated Admin capabilities, GuardDuty can easily manage and deployed via AWS Organizations.

GuardDuty **can be access from AWS RDSDB**, this is seen as part of defense evasion from  invictus-IR article [[cloud-detection-catalogue#defense-evasion techniques]]

As with other Security investment, it is ROI sensitive.

GuardDuty cost can be challenging due to the rates are based on amount of analyzed data from various, unpredictable sources like CloudTrail, Flow Logs, DNS.

## Latency

Another problem with GuardDuty is the finding will obviously have delay.
