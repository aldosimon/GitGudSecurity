CloudFront is **AWSâ€™ content delivery network**. CloudFront has the option to log to an S3 bucket or real-time logging if needed via a Firehose stream.

**What does it log?** [[How to be IR Prepared in AWS - Cado Security  Cloud Forensics & Incident Response#CloudFront]]
CloudFront logs detailed information about every user request that CloudFront receives.

**Where does it log to?** [[How to be IR Prepared in AWS - Cado Security  Cloud Forensics & Incident Response#CloudFront]]
Logs are stored in an S3 bucket, or for real-time logs in the Kinesis Firehose data stream.

**How do I enable it?** [[How to be IR Prepared in AWS - Cado Security  Cloud Forensics & Incident Response#CloudFront]]
CloudFront logs are **not enabled by default**. To enable CloudFront access logs:
1. Access the [CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home).
2. Choose the distribution you want to update.
3. On the General tab, under Settings, choose Edit.
4. For Standard logging, select On.
5. Choose the **S3 bucket where you want CloudFront** to deliver the log files. You can specify an optional prefix for the file names.

7. Choose one or more Kinesis data streams to receive real-time logs.Note: CloudFront real-time logs are delivered to the data stream of your choice in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. To read and analyze your real-time logs, you can build your own [Kinesis data stream consumer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html#real-time-log-consumer-guidance). Or, use [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html) to send the log data to Amazon S3, [Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html), [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/what-is-opensearch/), or a third-party log processing service.

**How do I access the logs?**[[How to be IR Prepared in AWS - Cado Security  Cloud Forensics & Incident Response#CloudFront]]
The standard logs can be downloaded from the S3 bucket. Accessing the real time logs is dependent on the endpoint of your Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
