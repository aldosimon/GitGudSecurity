Here is the TL;DR breakdown:

1. You gather your **primary sources** and create a note per source. Try to keep it concise and always tend to your meta data, it will be of much importance once your collection grows.

2. When you find a small "atomic" bit of information put it into a **compendium** note and keep aggregating those until they get too large. At this point split them into multiple notes.

3. Note down questions and ideas in **thoughts notes** that you have around the whole topic. Make references and comparisons to your primary sources. Do not try to answer them right away, just note.

4. Once reading your primary sources slows down to give you new insight, move on to reviewing your thinking notes, and pruning what questions are already answered or ideas invalidated.

5. Start writing ontologies, summaries, and answers to your own questions as you go.

6. Aim at making ontologies publishable and readable - something you can send to your colleague who doesn't know about your topic yet. These ontologies will be the basis of your next publication.

Workflow:
1. new source into clippings
2. read and move to 00_original if not a link
3. put summary in 01_source
4. put bitesize info in 02_compediums
5. put thoughts in 03_thoughts
6. arrange and answer 03_thoughts into 04_onthology
